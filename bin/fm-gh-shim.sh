# A `gh` shim that routes pull-request mutations through fm-gh.sh and gives the
# no-mistakes CI read one exact-head, least-privilege workflow-runs fallback.
#
# Install it as a SYMLINK named `gh` in a directory that precedes the real gh on the
# PATH of the process you need to intercept; bin/fm-gh-shim-install.sh owns
# installation, removal, and the precedence check. The symlink is required: the shim
# locates fm-gh.sh relative to its own real path, so a copy placed outside bin/ cannot
# find the wrapper. Read docs/no-mistakes-pr-credential.md before installing, because
# this shim is scoped to a PATH, not to a repository or a worktree, so every process
# resolving gh through that directory is affected.
#
# Credential-routed invocations, chosen because these are the two calls a
# fine-grained token is forbidden from and the pipeline's PR step makes both:
#   gh pr create ...
#   gh pr edit ...
# The CI monitor's exact `gh pr checks ... --json name,state,bucket,completedAt[,link]`
# shape first tries the real gh with the ambient narrow token. Only a 403-style
# authorization failure reaches fm-gh-ci-fallback.sh, which uses that SAME token
# to read the PR's exact head and workflow runs filtered by that SHA. It never
# reaches fm-gh.sh or config/gh-credential's broader token. Every other invocation
# execs the real gh unchanged, so the shim's default remains current behavior.
